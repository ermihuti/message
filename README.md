# Message App

## Project Overview

This project is a simple Svelte application where you can enter a message, and it will automatically display what you wrote. The application consists of three main parts: a header, a main section, and a footer.

## Features

- **Header**: Contains the title of the application.
- **Main Section**: Includes a text input where you can type your message and a div that displays the entered message in real-time.
- **Footer**: Displays additional information or links.

## How It Works

1. **Enter a Message**: Type your message into the text input field in the main section.
2. **Real-Time Display**: As you type, the message is displayed in a div below the input field.
3. **Header and Footer**: The header and footer provide context and additional information for the application.
